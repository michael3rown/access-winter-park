<h3>Mountain Biking</h3>

<p>Winter Park &amp; Grand County boasts some of the best mountain biking opportunities anywhere in Colorado. From heart-pounding high altitude climbs to fairly level trails winding along the valley floor, there is something here for everyone. 600 miles of marked, mapped and user-friendly trails wind through the fields of wild flowers, over the tops of the mountain peaks and back into the forest. Winter Park Resort has over 50 miles of lift accessible varied terrain trails and 3 terrain parks. Take your bike on specially equipped Zephyr Chairlift to the top, chose a route (color-coded by the level of difficulty) and bomb down the mountain or find a trail that will hook up with the other 600 miles of rails in the area. Enjoy the ride!</p>
