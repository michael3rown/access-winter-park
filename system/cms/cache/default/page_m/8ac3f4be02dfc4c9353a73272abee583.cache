<p><strong>2016&ndash;2017 Ski Season Opens November 16</strong></p>

<p>Winter Park Resort is located 67 miles (108 kilometers) northwest of Denver and 85 miles (137 kilometers) from Denver International Airport (DIA). Set in the Vasquez Mountains of the Arapaho National Forest, Winter Park is the closest major ski resort to Denver (1 1/2 hours driving time) via I-70 west to exit 232 onto U.S. Hwy 40 North.</p>

<p>Winter Park first opened in 1939 with a single rope tow and a $1.00 lift ticket. Since then Winter Park has developed into one of the top ten ski resorts in the United States. In 1975 Mary Jane Mountain opened. Revered for big bumps, deep chutes, tight glades and steep pitches, &ldquo;the Jane&rdquo; has earned cult-like status for her ego-humbling terrain. Mary Jane is consistently ranked #1 for moguls in North America by Skiing Magazine. Over the years additional sections of the mountain opened including Mary Jane&rsquo;s backside, Vasquez Ridge, Parsenn Bowl and, in 1997, Vasquez Cirque - the resort&rsquo;s most extreme and dramatic terrain. Today, Winter Park boasts 21 lifts serving 134 trails spread over more than 2,700 acres across four mountains.</p>

<p>Winter Park Resort received 377 inches of snowfall during the 2013-2014 season and has the most consistent snow season after season. Averaging 30 feet of snow annually entitles the resort to the coveted title of &ldquo;most snow of any major Colorado resort,&rdquo; a distinction that has been unchallenged for more than 64 years. With its proximity to Denver, just 67 miles away, Winter Park is a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts. A network of trails and lifts interconnects the distinct sections of each mountain. With five mountains to chose from (Winter Park, Mary Jane, Vasquez Ridge, Vasquez Cirque and Parsenn Bowl) and consistent annual snowfall, Winter Park offers a great experience for skiers and boarders of all abilities.</p>

For special occasions such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s, Martin Luther King holiday, President&rsquo;s Day and Valentine&rsquo;s Day, the Zephyr Express chairlift is modified to accommodate 20 gondola cabins for dinner service to The Lodge at Sunspot atop Winter Park Mountain.</p>

<h4>Snowmaking</h4>

<p>Snow is made on 26 trails covering 299 acres (121 hectares). The snowmaking capabilities guarantee the opening of Winter Park before Thanksgiving.</p>

<h4>Parks, Pipe &amp; Freeride</h4>

<p>Winter Park has expanded on its new terrain park, Rail Yard, with new progressive rails and improved jump design. Pipe aficionados head straight to the resort&rsquo;s new Superpipe on Allan Phipps trail. A 100-foot snow bridge whisks skiers and riders over Cranmer Cutoff for a more seamless transition between the park and the new Superpipe. Aspiring riders of all ages can test their skills in the expanded terrain park on Jack Kendrick trail with new jumps and rails. This year, the freeride scene at Winter Park Resort continues to push the progressive envelope with five levels of terrain parks. Rail Yard, Winter Park&rsquo;s advanced terrain, continues on its quest to impress taking home three Top 10 rankings in Transworld Magazine&rsquo;s 2005-2006 resort rankings for Best Park (tie for 4th), Best Overall Resort (8), and Best Pipe (10).</p>

<p>Last season&rsquo;s addition of Dark Territory, Rail Yard&rsquo;s limited access area, also continues to evolve with more unique features. Dog Patch, located on the east side of the Eskimo Express, offers skiers and riders an intermediate park system ideal for perfecting skills. Dog Patch East, Winter Park&rsquo;s latest addition to the freeride family, is located just east of the original Dog Patch, and will o er a variety of non-traditional jib features for skiers and riders. Starter Park, located below Snoasis, is for the beginner-jibber and features small rails perfect for those first attempts at rail sliding.</p>
